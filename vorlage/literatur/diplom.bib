abstract = {Elevated speed gas chromatography with a multicapillary column (MCC) was explored using mixtures of volatile alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons with a 160 mm long MCC at 27 C. The van Deemter curves showed broad minima with volumetric flows from 10-60 mL/min (average linear velocities of 12-70 cm/s) and HETP values of 0.5-3 mm; corresponding retention times were 10-200 s. In comparison, a 2.89 m fused silica capillary column exhibited narrower minima with volumetric flows of 5-20 mL/min (average linear velocities of 105-418 cm/s) and HETP values of 2-70 mm; retention times were 10-60 s at 41°C. The MCC exhibited symmetry factors of ca. 1.3 at 10 ng and this rose to ca. 2.0 at 100 µg; greater loadings may be possible but were precluded here by limitations in the injector rather than the column. Comparison in the separation of volatiles in gasoline showed comparable performance with the conventional fused-silica capillary column. A first examination ...},

abstract = {Recently, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) started to be used for direct breath analysis with respect to metabolic profiling, biomarker finding and gas trace analysis. The present review describes the basic operation of an ion mobility spectrometer including the ionization process, humidity effects and sampling procedures. To enhance the resolution, pre-separation by multi-capillary columns (MCCs) is discussed and examples for IMS chromatograms are presented. The focus is to review the analytical method IMS with respect to potential use for direct investigations of humid air in direct breath analysis but not on detailed discussion of results of specific medical application of MCC/IMS or on specific analytes found in exhaled air.},

abstract = {Multicapillary column gas chromatography (MC GC) is presented as a novel technique for the time-resolved sample introduction of gaseous analytes in atomic spectrometry. The principles and the theory of MC GC, the coupling of MC GC with microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry and with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and features of the coupled techniques developed are discussed. Applications of MC GC with element-selective detection to species-selective analysis are reviewed. The possibility of incorporating MC columns into dedicated sample preparation accessories for elemental speciation by atomic spectrometry is evaluated. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},
